# prototyping-group4
This is the shared repository for Group 4 (Cowboy Cactus Prototyping Department) during the API lab.

## The project (add as we go along)
We have chosen to look into the **[Tone.JS](https://tonejs.github.io/)** API as our physical prototype makes great use of different sounds. To get started we have used both the available tutorials and documentation on the Tone.js website and some tutorials on Youtube.

## Sources
The examples come from exercises on the **[Tone.JS](https://tonejs.github.io/)** website and from tutorials on Youtube.com.

### The  repository should contain:

    All your code
    The code should be commented
    A general README.md
    Explaining the project:
        What the project does
        Describe your project
        Why the project is useful
        What is the project is exploring (remember you are prototyping)
        How users can get started with the project
        How to use your code
        Who maintains and contributes to the project
        Who was responsible
    A folder for each example and prototype
    A README.md for each example and prototype

## Assessment

To pass the assignment you need to show you fulfill the following learning goal:

- Each group selects an API/library to investigate, identifying what is interesting about it for interaction designers, and creating examples that make use of it. Each group reports their findings with annotated code samples and a live demo (HP 2; LO 3 & 4)

- LO3 Independently locate and use a third-party programming library or API relevant to interactive technology

- LO4 Create cross-device interactive experiences

- Specifically you need to locate a library (on your own), try 2 coding examples each and extend 1 example into a prototype each. The code should be commented, where the examples are from should be clear and the requirements to the hand-in described in part no. 4 (Hand-in) of the assignment section should be fulfilled. 

- Identifying what is interesting for interaction designers and other reflections should be explained during the presentation.
