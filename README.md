Assignment details:
GitHub Repository
Submit a link to the repository of the API Lab assignment on Canvas. The  repository should contain:

    All your code
    The code should be commented
    A general README.md
    Explaining the project:
        What the project does
        Describe your project
        Why the project is useful
        What is the project is exploring (remember you are prototyping)
        How users can get started with the project
        How to use your code
        Who maintains and contributes to the project
        Who was responsible
    A folder for each example and prototype
    A README.md for each example and prototype

Do not make changes to the repository after you have handed it in. Doing so is considered cheating.
