## BPM slider
### What does it do?
Plays four notes and determines the bpm of them with a slider
## What does this example explore?
This example helped me understand how to connect the slider to the tone.js api and how to change the bpm. This is something that I can use later to indicate how close you are to our prototype.
## Installation
The examples crashes if you try to refresh your webpage and you have to restart the live server
Open the index html through the index.html with live server in vs code
For all examples i use the Tone.js CDN:
> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tone/14.8.10/Tone.js"></script>
To use tone this way you only need to put this script tag in the body of the main HTML document of any new Tone projects.
