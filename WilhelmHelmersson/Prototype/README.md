## Prototype
### What does it do?
There's a player that plays the classic jaws theme and then there's a volume slider that is also linked to the text
## What does this example explore?
This prototype was to help me fake a distance to the prototype and how the sound gets louder when you get closer.
## Installation
The examples crashes if you try to refresh your webpage and you have to restart the live server
Open the index html through the index.html with live server in vs code
For all examples i use the Tone.js CDN:
> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tone/14.8.10/Tone.js"></script>
To use tone this way you only need to put this script tag in the body of the main HTML document of any new Tone projects.
## Contributions
Code based on the examples from ["Player"](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/14.7.77/Player.html) which I expanded on
