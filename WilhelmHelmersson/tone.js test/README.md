## Drum Machine
### What does it do?
It's a simple drum machine with a couple of different drums that loops after 8 notes
## What does this example explore?
This example was the first one I did, I did it just to get a quick understanding of *Tone.js*. It helped me understand how to import *.wav* files and how to create loops.
## Installation
The examples crashes if you try to refresh your webpage and you have to restart the live server
Open the index html through the index.html with live server in vs code
For all examples i use the Tone.js CDN:
> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tone/14.8.10/Tone.js"></script>
To use tone this way you only need to put this script tag in the body of the main HTML document of any new Tone projects.
