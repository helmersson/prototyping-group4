These four prototypes were made using the [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) API library. Each of the folders have their own README explaining details regarding installation and purpose.

Refined_Prototype_Continuation is a continuation of the Refined_Prototype example where i wanted to try out how MP3 sounds and filters worked. I have kept both to showcase the possible differences between using synths and real sounds.
