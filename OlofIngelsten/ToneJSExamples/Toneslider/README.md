# Toneslider
## What does it do?
This prototype is based on the first "Hello Tone" example shown on the Tone.js website. It uses a HMTL slider element to change the pitch of the synthesizer that is playing. There are also buttons to turn it on and off.
## What does this example explore?
With this example I explored both how to make sound and synthesize it through Tone and how I then would connect it through the DOM to a website. Opening up Tone to the DOM gives you a plethora of tools to use when you need sound in web development. This is a very simple example but it is definitely scalable to larger projects where one might need sound effects, music, etc.
## Installation
For all examples i use the Tone.js CDN:
> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tone/14.8.10/Tone.js"></script>
To use tone this way you only need to put this script tag in the body of the main HTML document of any new Tone projects.

**To open my prototypes you only need to open index.html.**
## Contributions
Code based on examples from ["Hello Tone"](https://tonejs.github.io/) on the Tone.js website. All other code i made myself.
