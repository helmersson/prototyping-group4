# Polysynth
## What does it do?
This is a simple prototype that uses the Polysynth instrument to play the introduction melody to the 1954 classic **Mr.Sandman**. Press the button to play the melody.
## What does this example explore?
This example is a continuation of one of the limitations I found with the regular synthesizer, it's monophonic. This explores the possibilites of using polyphonic synths to play melodies. This is also a simple example with room for expansion, perhaps connecting MIDI files to play full songs or make a synthesizer website which allows users to play their own music perhaps.
## Installation
For all examples i use the Tone.js CDN:
> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tone/14.8.10/Tone.js"></script>
To use tone this way you only need to put this script tag in the body of the main HTML document of any new Tone projects.
## Contributions
Code based on examples from ["Instruments --> Polysynth"](https://tonejs.github.io/) on the Tone.js website. All other code i made myself.
