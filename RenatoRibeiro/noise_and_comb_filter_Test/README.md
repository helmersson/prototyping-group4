## Noise and filters Test

### What does it do?
This example creates a possible bee sound using noise generators, distortion and filters. It is expanded on the Prototype example.

### Installation and to use
The installation is done by using Tone.js CDN (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tone/14.8.10/Tone.js) into the html file.

To use the prototype open the index.html file on a browser.

### Contributions
The code was done by Renato Ribeiro.

This prototype uses the "Noise", "Filter","CombFilter", and "Distortion" examples from the Tone.js library(https://tonejs.github.io/).

Thanks to Peter Tolstrup Aagesen for the help.
