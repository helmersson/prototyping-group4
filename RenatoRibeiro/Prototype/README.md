## Distance and bee sound prototype

### What does it do?
This example prototypes how the distance influences the bee sound. Using a slider, the user can give a fictional distance value and listen to how it changes the sound. 

### Why is the project useful?

This prototype explores how distance can be used to influence the sound output of the bee.
It is also useful for user testing in a quick manner.
### Installation and how to use it
The installation is done by using Tone.js CDN (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tone/14.8.10/Tone.js) into the html file.

To use the prototype open the index.html file on a browser.
