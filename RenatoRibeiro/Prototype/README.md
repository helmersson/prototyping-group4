## Distance and bee sound prototype

### What does it do?
This example prototypes how the distance influences the bee sound. Using a slider, the user can give a fictional distance value and listen to how it changes the sound. 

### Installation
The installation is done by using Tone.js CDN (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tone/14.8.10/Tone.js).

### Contributions
This prototype uses the "Filter","PitchShift", and "Distortion" examples from the Tone.js library(https://tonejs.github.io/).
