# Prototype for plant project
## Refined prototype
For my refined protoype project I wanted to elaborate more on the vibration and touching functionallity for our prototype. 

## Features
I set up html, css and javascript files. I used the knowledge that I had explored in my first examples. I also decided to lookin into **Tone.Player** to learn more about adding your own sound, and in my case vibration sounds. Different feature are aslo being explored so as **playbackRate**. 

## Installation
I installed Tone.js with CDN. I put this script tag in the html to access the Tone.js library.  
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tone/14.8.10/Tone.js"></script>

## Contribution
For this first example I tried to learn a lot of the Tone.Js library. On their webside **https://tonejs.github.io/** I picked up a lot of information and knowledge to crete this refined prototype.
