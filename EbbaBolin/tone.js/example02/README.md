# Synthesizer
## Example 2 
On this second example I wanted to create somthing different and I also wanted to learn what I could do. When I googled about the Tone.Js I came a across this Synthesizer manny times whih I thought was very cool. Theirfor I dicided to lear more about these synth notes in this experiment. 

## Features
I set up html, css and javascript files. I created a container with both white and black notes. On the notes I created mouseevents fot them to be triggered when being mouse down and released when mouse up. This example exploring the Tone.PolySynthin the tone.js library, that are being used to creat instrument becuse you can play one tone at a time. 

## Installation
I installed Tone.js with cdn. I put this script tag in the html to access the Tone.js library.

## Contribution
For this example I took a lot of help and knowledge from a tutorial on youtube **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIxqNrooWws**. I changed small deitals in the code to learn even more about this part of Tone.js. This example exploring the **Tone.PolySynth** in the tone.js library.
