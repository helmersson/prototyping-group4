# Create your own symphony
## Example 1 
In this project I have created buttons to be able to create your own symphony on the webpage. With this examples I started to learn and explore about the tone.js library and the triggerAttack and triggerRelease. I eloberated on this together with synth notes from their library.

## Features
I set up html, css and javascript files. I created "on" buttons were they trigger different sounds from the tone.js synth library. The "off" buttons releases the synth notes. In this way you can "create your own symphony" with the different notes. In the end I styled the webbside.

## Installation
I installed Tone.js with CDN. I put this script tag in the html to access the Tone.js library.  
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tone/14.8.10/Tone.js"></script>

## Contribution
For this first example I tried to learn a lot of the Tone.Js library. On their webside **https://tonejs.github.io/** I picked up a lot of information and knowledge to crete this first expeirment.
