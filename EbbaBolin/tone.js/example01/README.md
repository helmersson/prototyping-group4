# Create your own symphony
## Example 1 
Buttons to be able to create your own symphony on the webpage. With this examples I started to learn about the tone.js library and about the triggerAttack and triggerRelease. I eloberated on this together with synth notes from their library.

## Features
I set up html, css and javascript files. I created buttons were the different buttons trigger a different sound from the tone.js synth library. The "off" notes releases the synth notes. In this way you can "create your own symphony" with the different notes.In the end I styles the webside.

## Installation
I installed Tone.js with cdn. I put this script tag in the html to access the Tone.js library.  
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tone/14.8.10/Tone.js"></script>

## Contribution
For this first example I tried to learn a lot of the Tone.Js library. On their webside **https://tonejs.github.io/** I picked up a lot of information and knowledge to crete this first expeirment.
